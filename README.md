These project contains the code that allow us to convert the speech into the text into android phone.
The source code contain two files an xml file and java file.

The frontend is written in the xml and the backend is written in the java.

Anyone can easily implement the feature of speech to text in there application (android)
by adding my code.

Thank you :)
